# copy paste

Before was it not possible to copy paste links into mpv that feature was seemingly added at 28.12.2024 (https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/15695). This script was based on something I found somewhere but I do not remember where. It is also now modified to use streamlink to play the video to hopefully resolve some playback skip issues I sometimes have

## Requirements

Besides mpv, have streamlink installed
